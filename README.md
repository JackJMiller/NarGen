# NarGen

Terrain generation for Nargon. Created by Jack Miller.

## Example usage

To generate a terrain world, you must first create the config files that configure the generation process. The following command configures a world named `mundo`.

`./nar-gen new-world mundo`

The config file for mundo can now be found in `configs/worlds/mundo.json`. The config files of the biomes referenced inside of this file can be found in `configs/biomes/`. The generation process can be tuned by changing the values found in these files.

The terrain world can now be generated by running the following command.

`./nar-gen generate configs/worlds/mundo.json`

Once the world has been generated, the result can be viewed in `images/`.

A help page can be viewed with the command `nar-gen --help`.
