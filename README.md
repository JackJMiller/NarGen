# NarGen

Terrain generation for Nargon. Created by Jack Miller.

## Usage

To generate a terrain world, you must first create the config files that configure the generation process. The following command configures a new world named `Mundo` using the sample configuration `Rainworld`.

`nargen new-world Mundo Rainworld`

The config files for Mundo can now be found in `configs/Mundo/`. The generation process can be tuned by changing the values found in these files. The other sample worlds available in `res/sample\_worlds/` can be listed with `nargen list-sample-worlds`.

The terrain world can now be generated by running the following command.

`nargen generate Mundo`

Once the world has been generated, the result can be rendered.

`nargen render Mundo`

A help page can be viewed with the command `nargen --help`.
